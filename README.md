# TODOs-App
Developed a TODOs App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) with Tailwind CSS for styling. Used the useState hook for efficient state management and useEffect for fetching data from the backend.This project enhanced my understanding of fetching data from the backend, displaying it on the frontend, and handling HTTP requests.
